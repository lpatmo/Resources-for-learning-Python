#Resources for Learning Python/Django

##Primary Resources
1. [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)
.. *52 exercises
.. *Notes: Exercises 1-15 were pretty straightforward. Was easier to do because I was already familiar with javascript and with using the command line.  
2. Learn Django!!!
.. *[Official Django guide](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/tutorial02/)
.. * The official Django guide takes you step-by-step through the building of a Django (1.6) polling app. Best for use with Python 2.7. The steps are straightforward, but there are a lot of new concepts to grasp with MVC.
3. [Codecademy Python track](http://www.codecademy.com)
.. *Notes: I went through about 43% of this track before I started on Learn Python the Hard Way. Codecademy makes for great practice typing out python syntax in response to simple questions.

6. [Khan Academy's Intro to Computer Science](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/computer-science-subject/computer-science)
.. * I ran through a couple of the videos in this track; I liked how completion was gamified. Only downside: there weren't any after-the-video exercises to get extra practice in.
